========================

Eform Builder Local Server With Xampp installed with Python

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
This currently works with Chrome Canary. It requires Flask to be installed, which depends on Python 2.7. To begin, install Google Chrome Canary. You can do that <a href='http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html'>here</a>.
<br>
Download Python 2.7 from <a href='https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.7/'>here</a>.
<br>
Once this completes, follow the steps outlined here to <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#windows-easy-install'>download pip</a>, which will help you get started with Flask.
<br>
</p>
<p>
In command line, as Administrator, run:
<code>
pip install Flask
</code><br>
Now, download the .zip of the latest repository. Open the directory in command line, and enter
<code>python formbuilder.py</code>
This will begin the Flask server. 
<br>
Open Google Chrome Canary. Enter 127.0.0.1:5000 in the address bar, and hit enter. Now you're ready to use the form builder!
